---Big O Notation--

-Cant describe algos just in terms of steps
-Steps vary in terms of input size
-Use a notation that considers how steps vary as N changes
-To simplify, lets use the highest order term from the relation between steps and N
-O(N) is linerar, O(1) is constant, ...etc
-refer to CLRS for a more mathematically rigorous explanation

--Soul of Big O--

-Constant steps = O(1)


--Log(N)--

-View binary search
-Based on successive halfings of the input data
-Inverse of exponents
-
