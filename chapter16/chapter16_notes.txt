---Heaps---
-specialty is when we want to keep tabs on greatst or least in a dataset

--Priority Queue--
-ER example
-insertion maintains order

--Heaps--
-binary heaps
-heap has additional conditions
-value of each node is greater than each of its descendants
-tree must be complete
-cant be any nodes next to an empty condition in a complete tree
-the heap inserts and deletes
-to insert:
  -place at rightmost bottom level
  -move up through the heap to maintain heap condition
-to delete
  -only ever delete the root node
  -move last node to root node, trickle root node down
-heaps can use array for implementation
-to work with the array, use this trick to find the children
  -left child is index * 2 + 1
  -right child is index * 2 + 2
-trickle up until the parent is greater than the child
-array implementation is the most common approach
-a heap can be used a priority queue
-maintains order and pops from the top
