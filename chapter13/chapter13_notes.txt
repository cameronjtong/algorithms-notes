---Recursive Algorithms for Speed---
-most computers are using quicksort
-not bubble sort or insertion sort
-recursion can speed up an algorithm although its missuse is responsible for some of the slowest

--Partitioning--
-to partition an array means to take a random value, the PIVOT
-for consistency we take the rightmost as the pivot
-you use this pivot and ensure than every number to the left of the pivot is less......
  -walkthrough
  -for given examples, use the rightmost value as pivot (any is valid)
  -left pointer continuosly moves to the right until value greater than pivot
  -right pivot moves left until it finds a value less than the pivot
  - if both pointers are stationary and left pointer is still on the left, swap them
  -reactivate left pivot
  -swap pivot with left pointer

--QuickSelect--
-need a value from a non-sorted array
-average case is NlogN, based on partitioning
