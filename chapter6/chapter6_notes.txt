---Optimizing for Optimistic Scenarios---

--Insertion Sort--

- remove value at index 1
-creates a gap
-like continually picking up cards and comparing the picked up card with the sorted cards
-O(N**2)
-average case is great for insertion sort
-most things we sort in industry are already partially sorted
-breaking early can save time that would be wasted in the loop
