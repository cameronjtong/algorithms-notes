---Recursion---

-solves difficult problems in easy ways
-top down vs bottom up way of thinking is introduced
-alternative to looping
-the computer adds to the call stack, so #factorial(3) resolves AFTER factorial(1)
-ex. factorial(3) is called first and completed last, as it requires the return values of its recursive calls
