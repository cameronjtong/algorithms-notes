---Speeding Up Your Code with Big O---

--Bubble Sort--
-Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm
-Given an array, make it ascending order
-Uses pointers that move from leftmost to rightmost
-for each cycle, the invariant is that the highest unsorted value is the rightmost element

--Quadratics--

-O(N**2) is more often that not due to nested loops
-Quadratic is relatively slow
-Always look for an alternative solution
-Think about what the absolute best case could be, we know we have to look at each value once so linear!
