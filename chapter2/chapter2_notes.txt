---Why Algorithms Matter---

-Set of instructions for a given task

--Ordered Array--

-Enforces order
-Must find valid index for insertion, like a set for duplication
-Right shifts necessary for left side inserts
-Unlike sets, this insertion search can stop when we get to a value greater than, and insert before it
-View linear search!

--Linear Search--

-N steps in a worst case


--Binary Search--

-Like playing a guessing game
-Works in successive halvings
-Hot/Cold response and adjustment
-For increasing inputs of N, binary search is far superior
-For binary search, each doubling of input size N only adds a single step (log(N))
