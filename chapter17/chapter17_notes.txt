---Trie---
-smartphone autocomplete
-tries can be used to allow for important features for text applications

--Tries--
-collection of nodes pointing to other nodes
-any number of child nodes
-final character has a child node, asterisk

--Trie Search--
-can search to see if its a complete word or at least a prefix

--Efficiency--
-as many steps as there are characters to check
-hash is O(1)
-O(K) because O(N) would refer to the number of nodes in the Trie

--Trie Insertion--
-works like search untill we find that no child node exists
-add a * child after

--Building Autocomplete--
-need method that returns an array of all the words in the trie
-method will accept any node of the trie and will return array of words that start with that

--Trie with Value--
-show the most popular options
-put the value as the child of the asterisk
