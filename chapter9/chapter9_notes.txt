---Stacks and Queues---

-new data structures
-temporary data
-they add additional restrictions to arrays

--Stacks--

-only insert and the end
-first in, last out
-last in, first out
-think like a stack of dirty dishes

--Abstract Data Types--

-must be implemented using array
-constrained data structures provide advantages

--Queues--

-first in first out
-add to the back and remove from the front
-like a lineup to buy tickets
