---Learning to Write in Recursive---

--Repeatadly Execute--
-different categories of problems
-different ways to solve different problems
-one trick is to pass in extra parameters

--Recursive Categories:Calculations--
-perform a calculation based on a subproblem
-think about what a subproblem is
-can use parameters to store an intermediate calculation and then return it at the end
-top down recursion is a new mental strategy
  -understand the subproblem
  -relax your brain and rely on the subproblem
--Array Sum--
-act as if the function has already been defined

--Staircase Problem--
-once you break down the problem into its subproblems, becomes simple
-how many paths to the top of the stairs given multiple step increments

--Anagram Generation--
-when applying top-down thinking, act as if the method has already been defined
-for anagrams, act as if you have all the anagrams but must just add in the last chatacter to each spot
